[PRODUCT] Sending request to API...
[PRODUCT] Response status: 200 OK
```

### STEP 6: Check Backend Terminal

```
üè∑Ô∏è [PRODUCT] Discount received from request: 27
üè∑Ô∏è [PRODUCT] Discount value to save: 27
[PRODUCT] ‚úÖ Product created successfully: Fresh Tomatoes
üè∑Ô∏è [PRODUCT] Product saved with discount: 27%
```

‚ùå **If you DON'T see these logs**, the discount is not being sent/received!

### STEP 7: Verify in Database (Optional)

If you have MongoDB Compass:
```javascript
// Search for your product
db.products.find({ title: "Fresh Tomatoes" })

// Should show:
{
  title: "Fresh Tomatoes",
  price: 50,
  discount: 27,  // ‚Üê This should be 27, NOT 0
  ...
}
```

### STEP 8: Check Home Page

1. **Logout** or open **Incognito window**
2. Go to: http://localhost:5173
3. Find your product: "Fresh Tomatoes"

[PRODUCTS] Fetched X products from backend
[PRODUCTS] Raw backend response: [...]
[HOME PAGE] Raw products from API: [...]

```
Original: ‚Çπ50
Discount: 27%
Savings: ‚Çπ50 √ó 27% = ‚Çπ13.50
Final Price: ‚Çπ50 - ‚Çπ13.50 = ‚Çπ36.50
```

### STEP 10: Test in Cart

1. Click **"View & Order"**
2. Add to cart
3. Open cart

**You should see:**
- Original price: ~~‚Çπ50~~
