# ✅ DISCOUNT DISPLAY - FIXED!

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

The discount was being **saved correctly** in the database and **returned by the backend**, but it was **NOT showing on the home page** because:

1. **Wrong file being updated** ❌  
   - I was updating `HomePage.tsx` 
   - But the actual component being used is **`FarmConnectMarketplace.tsx`**

2. **Discount field missing from mapping** ❌
   - Line 267-281 in `FarmConnectMarketplace.tsx`
   - Product mapping did NOT include `discount` field
   - So even though backend sent it, frontend ignored it!

---

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### 1. **Added Discount Field to Product Mapping**
**File:** `FarmConnectMarketplace.tsx`  
**Line:** 281

```typescript
// BEFORE ❌
return {
  id: p._id,
  name: p.title,
  price: p.price,
  farmer: farmerName,
  category: p.category || 'Other',
  image: p.imageUrl || '🌾',
  stock: p.quantity || p.stock || 100,
  rating: 4.5,
  status: p.status || 'available'
  // NO DISCOUNT!
};

// AFTER ✅
return {
  id: p._id,
  name: p.title,
  price: p.price,
  farmer: farmerName,
  category: p.category || 'Other',
  image: p.imageUrl || '🌾',
  stock: p.quantity || p.stock || 100,
  rating: 4.5,
  status: p.status || 'available',
  discount: p.discount || 0  // ✅ ADDED!
};
```

### 2. **Added Discount Badge to Home Page Preview** (Lines 1004-1058)
- Red "X% OFF" badge in top-left corner
- Original price with strikethrough
- Discounted price calculated and displayed

### 3. **Added Discount Badge to Products Page** (Lines 1102-1153)
- Same discount display
- Shows on all product cards

### 4. **Added Logging**
**Line:** 270
```typescript
console.log('[PRODUCT]', p.title, '- Farmer:', farmerName, '- Discount:', p.discount, '- Image:', p.imageUrl);
```

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### Step 1: Restart Frontend ONLY
```bash
# Kill frontend (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

**Backend is fine - no need to restart!**

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (hard refresh)
- Or: **Ctrl+Shift+Delete** → Clear cache

### Step 3: Open Home Page
- Go to: http://localhost:5173

### Step 4: Check Console
You should see:
```
[PRODUCT] BlackGram - Farmer: ... - Discount: 24 - Image: ...
[PRODUCT] Groundnut Oil - Farmer: ... - Discount: 10 - Image: ...
[PRODUCT] Maida - Farmer: ... - Discount: 10 - Image: ...
```

### Step 5: Check Visual Display

**BlackGram (24% discount):**
- ✅ Red badge: "24% OFF" in top-left
- ✅ Original price: ~~₹12/kg~~
- ✅ Discounted price: **₹9/kg** (₹12 - 24% = ₹9.12 ≈ ₹9)

**Groundnut Oil (10% discount):**
- ✅ Red badge: "10% OFF"
- ✅ Original price: ~~₹18/kg~~
- ✅ Discounted price: **₹16/kg**

**Maida (10% discount):**
- ✅ Red badge: "10% OFF"
- ✅ Original price: ~~₹24/kg~~
- ✅ Discounted price: **₹22/kg** (₹24 - 10% = ₹21.60 ≈ ₹22)
