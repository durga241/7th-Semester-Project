# Feature Updates Summary

## Date: October 25, 2025

### Three Major Features Implemented

---

## 1. âœ… Product Availability Control (Hide Unavailable Products)

### What Changed:
When farmers mark a product as **"Unavailable"** in their dashboard, the product is automatically **hidden from all customer views**.

### Implementation Details:

#### Backend (`server/models/Product.js`)
- Products have a `visibility` field: `'visible'` or `'hidden'`
- Products have a `status` field: `'available'` or `'unavailable'`

#### Backend API (`server/controllers/productController.js`)
- `getProducts()` API filters products by `visibility: 'visible'` (line 112)
- Only visible products are returned to customers
- `toggleVisibility()` function sets visibility to 'hidden' when status is 'unavailable' (line 258)

#### Frontend (`src/components/ComprehensiveFarmerDashboard.tsx`)
- Farmers can toggle product availability status (lines 809-893)
- When marked unavailable:
  - `visibility` â†’ `'hidden'`
  - `status` â†’ `'unavailable'`
- Alert confirms: "Product is now HIDDEN from customer home page"

### How It Works:
1. Farmer clicks "Mark as Unavailable" in dashboard
2. Product visibility changes to 'hidden' in database
3. Customer home page fetches only visible products
4. Unavailable products don't appear in customer listings

## 2. ðŸ”” Order Notifications with Bell Sound

### What Changed:

- Polls for new orders every **10 seconds**
- Compares current order count with previous count

**Bell Sound (Line 212):**
```javascript
const audio = new Audio('data:audio/wav;base64,UklGRnoGAABXQVZFZm10...');
audio.play();
```

- Gracefully handles audio playback errors

**Visual Notification (Lines 2320-2419):**

**Notification Content:**

- Message: "You have X new order(s) from customers"

### How It Works:
1. Customer places order
2. After 10 seconds, farmer dashboard polls API
3. Detects new order count increase
4. **Plays bell sound** ðŸ”Š
5. Shows notification badge
6. Opens notification panel
7. Updates order list

## 3. ðŸ’° Product Discount Feature with Visual Badge

### What Changed:

### Implementation Details:

#### Backend Changes

**Product Model (`server/models/Product.js` - Line 13):**
```javascript
discount: { type: Number, default: 0, min: 0, max: 100 }
```

**Product Controller (`server/controllers/productController.js`):**
- Line 97: Create product with discount

#### Frontend Changes

**State (Line 51):**
```javascript

```

**Form Field (Lines 1134-1146):**
- Label: "Discount (%)"
- Input type: number (0-100)
- Validation: `Math.min(100, Math.max(0, value))`
- Help text: "Optional: Offer discount (0-100%)"

**Save Handler (Lines 557, 586):**
- Includes discount in productData object
- Sends discount to backend via FormData

**Product Card Display (`src/components/ProductCard.tsx` - Lines 41-46):**
```jsx
{product.discount && product.discount > 0 && (
  <div className="absolute top-3 left-3 bg-red-500 text-white 
       px-3 py-1.5 rounded-lg text-sm font-bold shadow-lg animate-pulse">
    {product.discount}% OFF
  </div>
)}
```

**HomePage Display (`src/components/HomePage.tsx` - Lines 142-146):**
- Same discount badge as ProductCard

### How It Works:

3. Saves product to database
4. Customer views product on home page
5. Sees red badge: "20% OFF"
6. Badge pulses to attract attention
