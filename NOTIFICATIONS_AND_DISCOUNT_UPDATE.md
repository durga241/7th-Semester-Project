# Notifications and Discount Feature Update

## Date: October 25, 2025

## Summary
Successfully completed two major updates:
1. **Fixed Farmer Notification System** - Real-time order notifications now working properly
2. **Implemented Product Discount Feature** - Complete discount system from farmer dashboard to customer cart

---

## 1. Farmer Notification System Fix ✅

### Problem
The notification polling system was not working correctly because the `useEffect` dependencies were causing the interval to restart every time state changed, breaking the continuous polling.

### Solution
- **Added React refs** (`lastOrderCountRef` and `hasPlayedInitialCheckRef`) to persist values across re-renders
- **Removed dependencies** from the useEffect to prevent interval restart
- **Used refs in polling logic** to track order count changes without triggering re-renders

### How It Works
1. **Initial Load**: Fetches current orders and sets baseline count
2. **5-Second Delay**: Waits 5 seconds after login to avoid false notifications
3. **10-Second Polling**: Checks for new orders every 10 seconds
4. **Notification Trigger**: When new orders detected:
   - Plays beep sound
   - Shows notification badge with count
   - Displays notification panel automatically
   - Updates order list in real-time

### Files Modified
- `src/components/ComprehensiveFarmerDashboard.tsx`
  - Lines 78-79: Added refs for persistent tracking
  - Lines 137-261: Fixed polling logic with refs
  - Empty dependency array ensures interval runs continuously

## 2. Product Discount Feature ✅

### Implementation Overview
Complete end-to-end discount system allowing farmers to offer discounts that are visible throughout the customer experience.

### Backend (Already Existed)
- **Product Model**: `server/models/Product.js`
  - `discount` field (0-100%) already in schema
- **API**: Product endpoints already handle discount field

### Frontend Changes

#### A. Product Interface
**File**: `src/components/FarmConnectMarketplace.tsx`
- Added `discount?: number` to Product interface
- Added `_id?: string` for backend compatibility

#### B. Farmer Dashboard
**File**: `src/components/ComprehensiveFarmerDashboard.tsx`
- **Add/Edit Product Form**: Discount input field (0-100%)
- **Product Management**: Farmers can set and update discounts
- **Validation**: Ensures discount stays within 0-100% range

**Features**:
```typescript
- Input field with min="0" max="100"
- Hint text: "Optional: Offer discount (0-100%)"
- Stored in product state and sent to API
```

#### C. Product Display
**Files**: `ProductCard.tsx`, `HomePage.tsx`
- **Discount Badge**: Red animated badge showing "X% OFF"
- **Position**: Top-left corner of product image
- **Styling**: Red background, white text, pulsing animation

#### D. Shopping Cart
**File**: `src/components/FarmConnectMarketplace.tsx`
- **Cart Items**:
  - Shows discount badge per item
  - Original price with strikethrough
  - Discounted price in green
  - Calculates savings per item

- **Cart Total**:
  - Shows final total after discounts
  - Original total with strikethrough
  - Total savings displayed
  - Green color for discounted total

**Price Calculation**:
```typescript
const discount = product.discount || 0;
const finalPrice = product.price * (1 - discount / 100);
const itemTotal = Math.round(finalPrice * quantity);
```

#### E. Checkout Page
**File**: `src/components/FarmConnectMarketplace.tsx`
- **Order Summary**:
  - Discount badges on each item
  - Original and discounted prices
  - Total savings calculation
  - Final amount after all discounts

- **Stripe Integration**:
  - Updated payment amount calculation
  - Uses discounted prices for checkout
  - Minimum ₹50 check uses discounted total

## Technical Notes

### Refs vs State
- **State**: Used for UI updates (notification count, orders list)
- **Refs**: Used for tracking values without re-renders (polling logic)
- **Why**: Prevents useEffect from restarting interval on every state change

### Discount Calculation
- **Formula**: `finalPrice = price * (1 - discount / 100)`
- **Rounding**: `Math.round()` for clean currency values
- **Validation**: 0-100% range enforced in farmer dashboard

### Performance
- **Polling Interval**: 10 seconds (balanced for real-time feel)
- **Initial Delay**: 5 seconds (prevents false notifications on login)
- **Discount Calculation**: Computed in real-time, no caching needed
