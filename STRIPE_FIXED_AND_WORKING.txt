                        WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM?
================================================================================

ERROR MESSAGE:
"paymentInfo.method: `stripe` is not a valid enum value"

ROOT CAUSE:
The Order database model only allowed these payment methods:
❌ ['razorpay', 'cod', 'upi']

But we were trying to use:
❌ 'stripe'

SOLUTION:
✅ Updated Order.js model to include 'stripe' in the enum
✅ Added Stripe-specific fields (stripeSessionId, stripePaymentId)
✅ Added new payment statuses (cancelled, expired)
✅ Restarted the server

================================================================================
                        WHAT WAS FIXED
================================================================================

✅ Order model now accepts 'stripe' as payment method
✅ Added stripeSessionId field to store Stripe session
✅ Added stripePaymentId field to store payment intent
✅ Added 'cancelled' and 'expired' payment statuses
✅ Server restarted with new configuration
