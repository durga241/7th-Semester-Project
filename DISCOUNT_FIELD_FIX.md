# ✅ Discount Field Backend Fix

## 🐛 Problem
When farmers added products with a discount in the farmer dashboard, the discount value was not being saved to the database. This caused the discount to not appear on the home page even though the frontend was properly configured to display it.

## 🔍 Root Cause
The backend product creation and update routes in `server/index.js` were **not including the discount field** when saving products to the database.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Changes Made to `server/index.js`

#### 1. **Product Creation Route (POST /api/products)**
**Lines 712-722:** Added `discount` field to product creation
```javascript
product = await Product.create({
  title: req.body.title,
  description: req.body.description || '',
  price: Number(req.body.price),
  quantity: Number(req.body.quantity),
  category: req.body.category,
  farmerId: user._id,
  imageUrl,
  status: req.body.status || 'available',
  visibility: req.body.visibility || 'visible',
  discount: Number(req.body.discount) || 0  // ✅ ADDED
});
```

**Lines 730-741:** Added `discount` field to in-memory fallback
```javascript
product = {
  _id: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(),
  title: req.body.title,
  description: req.body.description || '',
  price: Number(req.body.price),
  quantity: Number(req.body.quantity),
  category: req.body.category,
  farmerId: user._id,
  imageUrl,
  status: req.body.status || 'available',
  visibility: req.body.visibility || 'visible',
  discount: Number(req.body.discount) || 0,  // ✅ ADDED
  createdAt: new Date()
};
```

#### 2. **Product Update Route (PUT /api/products/:id)**
**Line 853:** Added `discount` to the list of updatable fields (database)
```javascript
// Before:
['title','description','price','quantity','category','imageUrl','status','visibility']

// After:
['title','description','price','quantity','category','imageUrl','status','visibility','discount']  // ✅ ADDED
```

**Line 864:** Added `discount` to the list of updatable fields (in-memory)
```javascript
// Before:
['title','description','price','quantity','category','imageUrl','status','visibility']

// After:
['title','description','price','quantity','category','imageUrl','status','visibility','discount']  // ✅ ADDED
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Restart the Backend Server
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

### 2. Test Product Creation with Discount
1. Login as a farmer
2. Go to "Add Product" section
3. Fill in product details:
   - Name: "Fresh Tomatoes"
   - Price: ₹100
   - Quantity: 50
   - **Discount: 10%** ← Important!
4. Click "Add Product"
5. ✅ **Expected:** Product saves successfully

### 3. Verify Discount Appears on Home Page
1. Logout or open in incognito mode
2. Go to home page
3. Find the product you just added
4. ✅ **Expected Results:**
   - Red "10% OFF" badge visible in top-left corner
   - Original price (₹100) shown with strikethrough
   - Discounted price (₹90) displayed prominently
   - Price badge shows: ~~₹100~~ ₹90/kg

### 4. Verify in Cart
1. Add the discounted product to cart
2. Open cart
3. ✅ **Expected:**
   - Product shows ~~₹100~~ ₹90/kg
   - "10% OFF" badge visible
   - Cart total uses ₹90, not ₹100

### 5. Test Product Update
1. Login as farmer
2. Edit an existing product
3. Change discount from 0% to 15%
4. Save changes
5. Check home page
6. ✅ **Expected:** Product now shows 15% discount

## 📊 Database Schema
The `discount` field in the Product model:
```javascript
{
  discount: { 
    type: Number, 
    default: 0, 
    min: 0, 
    max: 100 
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Complete Flow

### Frontend (Already Working)
1. ✅ Farmer dashboard has discount input field
2. ✅ Discount value sent in API request
3. ✅ Home page displays discount badge
4. ✅ Cart calculates with discount
5. ✅ Orders use discounted price

### Backend (NOW FIXED)
1. ✅ Receives discount from request body
2. ✅ Saves discount to database
3. ✅ Updates discount on edits
4. ✅ Returns discount in API responses

## 🔄 Before vs After

### Before Fix ❌
```javascript
// Farmer adds product with 10% discount
POST /api/products
{
  title: "Tomatoes",
  price: 100,
  discount: 10  // ← Sent by frontend
}

// Backend saved:
{
  title: "Tomatoes",
  price: 100
  // discount: NOT SAVED ❌
}

// Home page received:
{
  title: "Tomatoes",
  price: 100,
  discount: 0  // ← Default value
}
// Result: No discount shown ❌
```

### After Fix ✅
```javascript
// Farmer adds product with 10% discount
POST /api/products
{
  title: "Tomatoes",
  price: 100,
  discount: 10  // ← Sent by frontend
}

// Backend saves:
{
  title: "Tomatoes",
  price: 100,
  discount: 10  // ✅ NOW SAVED!
}

// Home page receives:
{
  title: "Tomatoes",
  price: 100,
  discount: 10  // ✅ Correct!
}
// Result: "10% OFF" badge shown, price ₹90 ✅
```

## 📌 Key Points
- Default discount value is **0** (no discount)
- Discount range is **0-100** (percentage)
- Frontend already had full discount support
- Only backend saving was missing
- Fix applies to both creation and updates
- Works with both database and in-memory storage

## ✅ Status
**Issue:** RESOLVED  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Files Modified:** `server/index.js` (4 locations)

**The discount feature is now fully functional end-to-end! 🎉**
