## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Discount Not Showing on Home Page

**Check 1: Database**
```bash
# In MongoDB shell or Compass, check:
db.products.find({ title: "Fresh Tomatoes" })
# Should show: discount: 15
```

**Check 2: Browser Console**
```javascript
// In browser console, type:
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

**Check 3: Backend Logs**
- Look for: `🏷️ [PRODUCTS] Fresh Tomatoes has 15% discount`
- If you don't see this, the product doesn't have a discount in the database

**Check 4: Frontend Console**
- Open DevTools → Console
- Look for product data being loaded
- Check if discount field is included

### Problem: Discount Field Not Highlighted

**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check if you're on the latest code

### Problem: Backend Not Receiving Discount

**Check:**
1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
2. Add a product
3. Find the POST request to `/api/products`
4. Click on it → Payload tab
5. Look for `discount: 15` in the form data
